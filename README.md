# What is this?

tl;dr; This is the /usr/ directory from a Fritz!Box 7330 router.

I have a Fritz!Box 7330 router laying arround and I've been trying to see what I can do with it.
I was able to enable the telnet protocol on the admin page of the router and connection to it via telnet, while exploring the router's filesystem I found lots of files, the /usr/ directory caught my eyes the most so I've decided to publish it to GitHub if someone is interesting in researching it.

# How did you extract the files from it?

I have enabled telnet protocol on the router's configuration page, more about that here: https://blog.lix.cc/blog/tag/fritzbox-7390/
After than I plugged a USB drive stick into the router's USB port.
I've connected to the router over telnet via PuTTY on Windows.
I've used the tar command to put the /usr/ directory in a archive inside my USB stick.

And that would be it, the /usr/ directory was on my USB stick.
